# Smart-Weather-Prediction-using-ML

Weather forecasting is simply the prediction of future weather based on different parameters of the past like temperature, humidity, dew, wind speed and direction, precipitation, Haze and contents of air, Solar and terrestrial radiation etc. Weather forecast is an essential factor affecting peopleâ€™s lives. Weather forecast notices are important because they can be used to prevent destruction of life and environment. 

In this Machine Learning project, we will predict the vital factors of weather parameters and Predict the summary of the weather of each day and each hour.


Dataset used in the machine learning project is uploaded in the same directory.
